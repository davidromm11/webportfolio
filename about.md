        I'm a recent Data Science graduate from St. Lawrence University with a passion for tech, especially cybersecurity. I'm currently spending time researching the field with the goal of building a career around it.

        Outside of tech, you'll often find me at the golf course, the gym, or spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy cooking and fishing.

        I've always been the type of person who can't fully grasp a topic until I understand <i>everything</i> about it. This pushes me to learn deeply and solve problems with a thorough, well-informed approach. In a field where a single issue could have hundreds of possible causes, it's rewarding to find the solution because it shows you understand how to work through all those possibilities.

        This blog serves a few purposes: it's my space to practice web development, VPS configuration, web hosting, and writing. It's also a place where I can organize my thoughts and solidify my comprehension of topics, all while tracking my progress. Over time, I hope these posts will turn from personal learning notes to something that helps others.
